### Hi there! I'm Marta Geraldo. 


 Iâ€™m learning to be better at  Front-end Developer and Java Developer daily.

 Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with good people to add lasting values to growth-oriented organizations, through hard work and commitment...and also to work within a dynamic, motivating and enriching environment while developing more skills and competences, and applying all acquired in developing resources that will enhance the organizationâ€™s overall worth.

I'm available to jobs.
